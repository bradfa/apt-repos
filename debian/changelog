apt-repos (1.48.0) bionic; urgency=medium

  * added lost test 'returncodes' and fixed return codes in clitests
    return codes in clitests partly changed (and got quite better) after switching
    to new apt_repos.suppress_unwanted_apt_pkg_messages mechanism.
  * fixed non working IS_GIT_REPO gates
  * exclude .git-files from debian source package
  * fixed lintian errors and some warnings
  * better errorhandling in case of KeyErrors in .suites-files
  * unified privat method names
  * added PWD expansion for file://-Urls
  * fixed new URL expansion for file urls with spaces
  * added debian/.debhelper/ to gitignore
  * documented new {PWD} variable for file urls in .repos files
  * supporting self contained .repos-suite definitions which need no physical scan
  * fixed: only use codenames really available in the Release-file
  * added documentation for Codename-key and new self-contained repos-definitions
  * more uniform formattings
  * better error message
  * repos-config: preferring suitename from 'Suite'-keyword if specified
  * new valid ubuntu packages/repository versions

  * RepositoryScanner ensures that Release-File defines a Suite.
    Today I learned, that there can also be Release-Files for Archives
    which don't define the key 'Suites'.
  * test: approved regular update of ubuntu's git
  * added PackageField.PHYSICAL_COMPONENT that extracts the component out of the file- or directory name
  * apt_repos/Repository: be more robust against tofu in config files
  * catch FileExistsError when creating the apt caching structure
  * using utf-8 encoding when loading json files
  * typical ubuntu updates effecting tests

apt-repos (1.47.0) bionic; urgency=medium

  * NON BACKWARD COMPATIBLE:
    * Changed syntax of 'Suites'-key in .repos files. This is done as
      preparation for more enhanced .repos features below.

  * NEW FEATURES:
    * Updated Documentation Readme.md and new docs/Configuration.md
    * Added new PackageField.SIZE to provide size information about binary and
      source packages.
    * Added new override-configuration feature with the config key 'Oid' to
      override single key/value pairs of a config
    * Added support for common and suite specific Tags in *.repos config files
    * RepositoryScanner: added Support for local file:// urls
    * Repository: implemented Url-Key within Suites-lists in .repos files
    * Introduced separators in Suites-lists in .repos-files
    * Introduced the new key 'Codename' for .repos configs

  * Bugfixes:
    * setting PYTHONPATH in bin/apt-repos itself - allows bin/apt-repos to be
      called standalone
    * better error messages in case of config file errors
    * reduce amount of info messages for repository scan - only one line per
      repo
    * fixed scanning of repos by empty suite selector
    * handling of the most typical Exception during cache update and less
      verbose output in debug-mode
    * better workaround for unwanted lib-apt output to stdout using a fork/pipe
      construct
    * apt-repos: don't override repos-config when reading latter config dirs
      and ensure defined suite ordering
    * Repository: ensured that the config-Key 'Repository' is really optional
    * getSuites: warning in case of KeyError's in repos descriptions

  * Code- and development improvements:
    * improved apt_repos.suppress_unwanted_apt_pkg_messages() to be used just
      within single subtasks of the main process
    * added comments for apt_repos.setAptReposBaseDir and apt_repos.getSuites
    * added RepoSuite.getTrustedGPGFile() and some comments
    * first run all tests if we are in a git tree and check later for
      differences
    * handled a lot of pylint errors/warnings
