.SH SYNOPSIS
 \fBapt\-repos\fR [-h] [-b BASEDIR] {list,ls,sources,src,source,suites,show,dsc} ...


.SH DESCRIPTION
Display information about binary PACKAGE(s) in diverse apt\-repositories and suites.
.br
   This tool uses apt\-mechanisms to scan for repositories/suites that are registered in
.br
   a suites\-file. For each repository/suite combination a local caching folder
.br
   is created in which downloaded Packages files are stored, similar to the cache
.br
   known from apt\-cache which lives in /var/lib/apt/lists.

                        Set a new/custom basedir for config-data and caching.
                        Please provide the basedir as an absolute path. The
                        default is $HOME/.apt-repos. The basedir must at least
                        contain a file named 'suites'. The cache will be
                        created into a subfolder called '<basedir>/.apt-
                        repos_cache'.
