                      package [package ...]

subcommand list: search and print a list of binary packages

positional arguments:
  package               Name of a binary PACKAGE or source-package name
                        prefixed as src:SOURCENAME

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           Switch on debugging message printed to stderr.
  -s SUITE, --suite SUITE
                        Only show info for these SUITE(s). The list of SUITEs
                        is specified comma-separated. The default value is
                        'default:'.
  -a ARCHITECTURE, --architecture ARCHITECTURE
                        Only show info for ARCH(s). The list of ARCHs is
                        specified comma-separated.
  -c COMPONENT, --component COMPONENT
                        Only show info for COMPONENT(s). The list of
                        COMPONENTs is specified comma-separated. Note:
                        component and section fields are not exactly the same.
                        A component is only the first part of a section
                        (everything before the '/'). There is also a special
                        treatment for sections in the component 'main', in
                        which case 'main/' is typically not named in a
                        section-field. For this switch -c we have to specify
                        'main' to see packages from the component 'main'.
  -r, --regex           Treat PACKAGE as a regex. Searches for binary package-
                        names or binary packages that were built from a source
                        prefixed with 'src:'. Examples: Use regex '.' to show
                        all packages. Use regex '^pkg' to show all packages
                        starting with 'pkg'. Use regex '^src:source' to show
                        packages that were built from a source starting with
                        'source'.
  -O, --no-old-versions
                        Ignore old package versions found in a suite.
  -nu, --no-update      Skip downloading of packages list.
  -nh, --no-header      Don't print the column header.
  -col COLUMNS, --columns COLUMNS
                        Specify the columns that should be printed. Default is
                        'pvsaSC'. Possible characters are: (p)=Package,
                        (v)=Version, (s)=Suite, (a)=Arch, (S)=Section,
                        (y)=PhysCompo, (P)=Priority, (z)=Size, (C)=Source,
                        (L)=Long-Desc, (R)=Full-Record, (B)=Base-Url,
                        (F)=File-Url
  -f {table,list,grouped_list}, --format {table,list,grouped_list}
                        Specifies the output-format of the package list.
                        Default is 'table'. Possible values: 'table' to pretty
                        print a nice table; 'list' to print a space separated
                        list of columns that can easily be processed with bash
                        tools; Use 'grouped_list' to do nearly the same as
                        'list' but add a newline for each new value in the
                        first column (which means we group over identical
                        values in the first column).
  -di DIFF, --diff DIFF
                        Specify the character of a colunm over which we should
                        compare two different results. The character needs to
                        be one of the characters described for the --columns
                        switch. Typical useful comparisons are e.g. comparing
                        the results for two different architectures i386/amd64
                        (a) or comparing two different suites (s). Since we
                        can just compare two different results, please ensure
                        that the result set of your query returns exactly two
                        different values for the specified column. It could be
                        necessary to ignore some results. E.g if '--diff a' is
                        specified and our query returns 3 results for the
                        architectures 'amd64', 'i386' and 'all', we might want
                        to ignore architecture 'all' packages. This can be
                        done using the argument '--diff a^all' which would
                        ignore the architecture 'all' packages and just
                        compare 'amd64' and 'i386' packages.
  -dt DIFF_TOOL, --diff-tool DIFF_TOOL
                        Diff-Tool used to compare the separated results from
                        --diff. Default is 'diff,--side-by-side,--suppress-
                        common-lines,--width=<ttyWidth>'. Use , (instead of
                        spaces) to provide arguments for the difftool.
